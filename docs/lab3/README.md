# More advanced queries

In this lab, we'll look at some more advanced queries, including projections, sorting, and searching within embedded documents and arrays. We'll be working in Compass for this lab, as it makes it easier to see changes to your queries in real-time, but the same query filters can be used in mongosh, or your programming language of choice.
