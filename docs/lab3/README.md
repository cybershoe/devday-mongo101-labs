# More advanced queries

In this lab, we'll look at some more advanced queries, including projections, sorting, and searching within embedded documents and arrays. 

> [!NOTE] We'll be working mostly in Compass for this lab, as it makes it easier to see changes to your queries in real-time, but the same functionality is available in the language-specific driver for your programming language of choice.
