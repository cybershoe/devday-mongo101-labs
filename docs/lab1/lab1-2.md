# Connecting to your Cluster with MongoDB Compass

## The Compass GUI
[MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) is a free
graphical tool for interacting with your MongoDB clusters. It is an easy way
to explore your database, run queries, build
[aggregation pipelines](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/),
evaluate query performance, and more. Compass has been pre-installed on your
jumphost.

## LAB: Connect with MongoDB Compass

and paste it into the `URI` field in the New Connection dialog box.
> ðŸ‘† **Note**: The jumphost is running Ubuntu Linux with the Xfce dekstop
> environment. If you are using a Mac, you'll need to use ^&nbsp;C and
> ^&nbsp;V instead of âŒ˜&nbsp;C and âŒ˜&nbsp;V to copy and paste, respectively.
4. Click "Save and Connect"
