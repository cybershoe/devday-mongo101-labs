# MongoDB 101 Developer Day Labs {docsify-ignore}

Welcome to MongoDB 101! These hands-on exercises will take you through the basics of interacting with MongoDB Atlas. In these labs, you'll use MongoDB's GUI and CLI tools, as well as the Python native driver to interact with a real MongoDB Atlas cluster. By the end of this session, you will understand the basics of connecting to an Atlas cluster, common CRUD operations, aggregations, and indexes.

> [!TIP]
> The earlier labs will be very step-by-step and involve either pre-written code or copying and pasting commands. Later labs will require more independent problem solving. This is by design. Feel free to refer back to earlier labs if you need a refresher on a certain tool or command, or ask your neighbour or lab facilitator for pointers. No one is keeping score; we're here to learn and explore together.
